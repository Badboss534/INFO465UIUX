## One-Line Summary of Each Screen

Home Screen (home.html): Central navigation hub that allows users to access student and instructor features.

Course Search (course.html): Allows users to search for courses by department, instructor, or course ID.

Student Registration (registration.html): Simulates student login and allows students to enroll in courses.

Instructor Schedule (instructor.html): Displays instructor teaching schedules and allows viewing of student rosters.

Session Enrollment (session.html): Shows a list of students enrolled in a selected course session.

## HTML/CSS/JavaScript Elements and Techniques Used

HTML:

* Used semantic elements such as <nav>, <table>, and <section> for page structure.
* Created multiple pages for navigation between system features.

CSS:

* Used a global stylesheet (style.css) for consistent layout and design.
* Applied Flexbox and Grid for page layout.
* Implemented consistent colors, buttons, and fonts.

JavaScript:

* Used DOM manipulation to update page content.
* Used arrays to simulate data storage.
* Implemented search filtering for courses.
* Implemented validation logic to prevent duplicate registration.
* Used conditional rendering to simulate login behavior.

## Design Challenges and Decisions

Consistency:
A shared CSS file was used to ensure all pages had the same layout and design.

Usability:
Navigation links and simple layouts were used to make the system easy to use.

Validation Without Backend:
Since no database was used, JavaScript arrays were used to track enrolled courses and simulate system functionality.

Since no database was used, enrollment validation was implemented using JavaScript arrays to track enrolled courses within the browser session, effectively demonstrating system behavior.
