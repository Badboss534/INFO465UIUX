Screen Summaries (One-Line Description)

Home Screen (index.html): Central navigation hub providing role-based access for students and instructors.

Course Search Screen (search.html): Allows users to filter courses by department, instructor, or course ID.

Student Registration (registration.html): Simulates student login, class viewing, and session enrollment.

Instructor Schedule (instructor.html): Displays assigned courses and student rosters for instructors.

Session Enrollment (session.html): Shows enrolled students for a selected course session.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Techniques Used
HTML5

Semantic elements such as <nav>, <section>, and <table> for structured content.

Organized page layouts for accessibility and readability.

CSS3

Global stylesheet (style.css) for consistent design across all pages.

Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout structure and responsiveness.

Consistent color scheme, typography, and button styling.

JavaScript

DOM manipulation to update page content dynamically.

Arrays to simulate data storage.

Search filtering functionality.

Validation logic to prevent duplicate registrations.

Conditional rendering for login simulation and content display.

Design Challenges and Decisions
Consistency

A shared external CSS file was used to ensure uniform fonts, colors, and layouts across all pages built by different team members.

Usability

Quick Action cards were added to the home screen to reduce navigation steps and improve user experience.

Validation Without Backend

Since no database was used, enrollment validation was implemented using JavaScript arrays to track enrolled courses within the browser session, effectively demonstrating system behavior.
